# Seevibes Pre-Interview Test

Welcome to Seevibes! Thank you for thinking about our company.

Before we do an interview, we want to see a bit of code, and see how you work. This repository has the basic information you need to complete the task.


## Test

Create a command-line program that will connect to the IMDB API and given a partial movie name on the command line, will return the full title and release year of the movie. Some examples:

    $ ./program batman
    Title: Batman Begins
    Year: 2005

    $ ./program avengers
    Title: The Avengers
    Year: 2012


## Procedure

1. Fork this repository
2. Create the program
3. Submit a pull request, tagging @francois
4. We will send you an email to confirm the interview details

Whether you've applied to Seevibes through an internship program, or just want to have fun, go ahead! Fork and tell us.
